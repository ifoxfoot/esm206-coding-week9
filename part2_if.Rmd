library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(broom)
```

## Read in data

```{r}
lizards <- read.csv(here("data", "lizards.csv"))
```

Get counts of lizards by species
```{r}
lizards %>% 
  count(spp) %>% 
  arrange( -n)
```

## Make a subset

- UTST Lizards

-Sites: IPBE (enclosure grassland), RABB (rabbits mesquite site), "EAST" (east tarbush site)

-Tail condition is recorded (W = whole, B = Broken)

```{r}
utst <- lizards %>% 
  filter(spp == "UTST") %>% 
  filter(site %in% c("IBPE", "RABB", "EAST")) %>% 
  filter(tail %in% c("B", "W"))
```
